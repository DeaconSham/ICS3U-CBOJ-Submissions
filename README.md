# ICS3U-CBOJ-Submissions
Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science submissions on CBOJ at Colonel By Secondary School.
Only Unit 4 & 5 Assignments and Unit 5 & 6 Exercises posted.
Open folders named "src" in each submission to see .java files (files with the code).
Do not copy my code for your CBOJ submissions for ICS3U because plagiarism is bad.
Only use it as a reference for your own learning; please and thank you! :D
